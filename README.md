# livebackup
Simply create a bootable squashfs live systems from your running Linux

This is a bash script aiming to create a bootable squashfs file from a installed Linux system
or the live system it self. It's modified from the "Live Ubuntu Backup" script originaly
written by billbear@gmail.com. I simplified the code, focusing on only live system backup, and
make it working for not only Ubuntu, but also for any other Linux distribution.
